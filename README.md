# Chiva-webshop

This is an assignment project for Hack Your Future API module class 33.

Chiva is an online webshop with dummy products. There is an index page with the option to select from a few categories. When a product category is selected, the website will interact with the API to fetch dummy products. The user can interact and filter the type of products based on their price and sales reviews. Upon loading the product information, including a photo, the products can be added to the cart or removed from it. The cart can contain the value or information about the product and will redirect them to the payment page.
